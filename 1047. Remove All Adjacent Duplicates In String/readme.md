## concept: using string as a stack
First we create a string "result" to store the final answer.<br>
Then we check the input string one by one using for loop.<br>
If result's size doesn't equal to zero and it's last char is the same to the input char, we pop the last char in "result" out.<br>
Otherwise, push the input char to the result.
